If your specified Incline Angle is 0, then the Ground is a level surface that's your specified Eye Height #1 below your eyes. For Measure Height and Measure Length, make sure the actual ground you're standing on matches that description.\n\nGround Point: For Parallel, Hypotenuse, and Free measurements, the Ground Point is the point on the ground at the position of the object's first end point. You can aim at either end point first, but the Ground Point must be at the position of the end point you aim at first. For Perpendicular Measurements, the Ground Point is the point on the ground at the Perpendicular Point's position.\n\nPerpendicular Point: If you face the object at a direction perpendicular to its length, the Perpendicular Point is the point on the object that you're facing.\n\nPress and Release: If you're told to press and release, then after aiming at the target you'll press the ENTER button and immediately release it.\n\nPress and Hold: If you're told to press and hold, then after aiming at the target you'll press the ENTER button and hold it, then aim at your next target before releasing it.\n\nHeight: Height is the measurement in the vertical direction.\n\nDepth: Depth is the measurement in the horizontal direction from you to the first point that you aimed at. The exception is Measure From Two Positions: Free, in which Depth is the direction of your Stride Distance.\n\nWidth: Width is the horizontal direction perpendicular to Depth.\n\nLength: Length is the pythagorean combination of Depth and Width (Depth² + Width² = Length²).\n\nSlant: Slant is the pythagorean combination of Length and Height."/>
