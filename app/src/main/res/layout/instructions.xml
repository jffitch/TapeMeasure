This is only available in the Full Version. Be sure to reset this to 0 when you're done using it.\n\nGround Incline is used with Measure Height, Measure Length, and Measure Using Camera. It is not used with Measure From Two Heights or Measure From Two Positions because the ground altitude is irrelevant.\n\nWhen setting a Ground Incline angle, the device will also save the direction you were facing when you set it, which will be known as the Incline Direction. If you have a Ground Incline set when using Measure Height, you'll be asked whether you want the device to assume you're facing the Incline Direction or to use the magnetic sensor to determine what direction you're facing. When using Measure Length: Free, the magnetic sensor will be used to determine what direction you're facing. When using another Measure Length, the device will assume you're facing the Incline Direction for the first step.\n\nIf you plan on using Measure Length: Free or Measure Height: Magnetic Sensor, make sure you are facing the direction of the incline when you set it. Face where the incline is either the highest or the lowest.\n\nWhen using Measure Length: Parallel, Hypotenuse, or Free, if you press and release on the first step, then only the first step (when aiming at the ground) will use the ground incline, and the two object points will be assumed to be the same altitude. If you press and hold for the first step, both object points will be assumed to be on the ground, meaning that they will not be the same altitude if you have the Ground Incline set to something other than 0.\n\nWhen measuring using the camera, the Ground Incline is used as the incline of the surface that the phone and the object are on. The incline is assumed to be in the direction that the camera is facing.\n\nGround Incline is only used when measuring. When calibrating, Ground Incline is assumed to be 0.\n\nIn order to get accurate results, the incline must be uniform. A uniform incline is an otherwise level surface or ground that is just slanted at an angle. A non-uniform incline has random bumps." />

                android:text="When measuring from two heights or two positions, you will get more than one measurement (Height, Depth if parallel, Width if perpendicular, Depth and Width if free). If you know the object is not supposed to have that measurement (i.e. a perfectly vertical object shouldn't have Width or Depth, a perfectly horizontal object shouldn't have Height), you can select that check box and click FIX to remove that measurement for more accurate results. This will be calculated by slightly changing the angles used until that measurement becomes 0. A new measurement called Angle Adjustment will appear, which will show how much the Pitch angle had to change to remove the measurement.\n\nBecause Yaw is usually much less accurate than Pitch, Measuring From Two Heights Free and removing Width will just remove the Yaw measurement and show what the results would be if you were measuring Parallel.\n\nIf you use Remove Depth when Measuring From Two Positions Using Both Object Positions, it can be used as another method of measuring Height. See the Steps category for more details." />

Measuring using the Pitch angle only (you specify whether you're Parallel, Perpendicular, Inside, or Outside) will always be more accurate than measuring using the Yaw angle (any measurement labeled as &quot;Free&quot;).\n\nWhen measuring using the magnetic sensors, (anything labeled as &quot;Free&quot;), make sure you're not near any magnets, and make sure you've viewed the Calibrate: Set Precision screen to see if the Yaw is working correctly. Every time you rotate 90°, the Yaw should change by 90°.\n\nWhen aiming, make sure you always wait for the click, and keep the phone still until after pressing or releasing.\n\nFor any measurement method, you must follow all of the steps from the same height and position, unless specifically instructed otherwise.\n\nIf you're too close to the object you're measuring, a slight movement will make a big difference in the measurement. If you're too far, a slight tilt will make a big difference. You should measure from a happy medium. If you have more trouble standing still, you should be further from the object. If you have more trouble keeping your hands still, you should be closer to the object.\n\nIf you're using Measure Length or Measure From Two Positions (except Using Both Object Positions), avoid measuring anything at eye level. A small accidental change in the tilt will make a big error in the measurements." />
